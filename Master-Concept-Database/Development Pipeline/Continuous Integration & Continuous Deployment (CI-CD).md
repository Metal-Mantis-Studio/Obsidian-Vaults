Continuous Integration (CI): Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository. With each integration, an automated build and test process is triggered to ensure that the changes are integrated smoothly and do not introduce conflicts or errors. CI helps catch integration issues early and promotes a collaborative and streamlined development workflow, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software more frequently and reliably.
Tools Include: [[Azure Pipeline]] & [[Jenkins]], [[GitLab CICD]]

Continuous Deployment (CD): Continuous Deployment is an extension of Continuous Integration where code changes that pass automated tests are automatically deployed to production environments. With CD, the entire software delivery process is automated, allowing new features, bug fixes, and improvements to be rapidly and safely deployed to users. This approach reduces manual intervention, minimizes the time between code completion and deployment, and increases the ability to receive feedback quickly, leading to faster and more reliable delivery of software updates.
Tools Include: [[Azure Pipeline]], [[Azure App Service Deployment Service]], [[Azure Kubernetes]], [[Azure DevOps]], [[Octopus Deploy]], [[Bamboo]]
