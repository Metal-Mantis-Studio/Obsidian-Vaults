BlackDuck is a tool which helps organisations identify and mitigate open source security, license compliance and code-quality risks. It also has a plug in with [[Team Foundation Server (TFS)]] allowing you to automatically find and fix vulnerabilities allowing you to receive alerts and fail builds when BlackDuck violation policies are met. [[White Source]] does pretty much the same thing
