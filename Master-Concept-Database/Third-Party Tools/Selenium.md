Selenium is a powerful open-source software suite designed for automating web browsers and facilitating automated testing and interaction with web applications. It provides a set of tools and libraries that allow developers and testers to write scripts in various programming languages (such as Java, Python, C#, etc.) to simulate user interactions with web pages, perform [[Functional Testing]] and [[Regression Testing]], and validate the behaviour of web applications across different browsers and platforms. Selenium's ability to control web browsers and mimic real user actions makes it an invaluable tool for ensuring the quality and reliability of web applications in an automated and repeatable manner.
