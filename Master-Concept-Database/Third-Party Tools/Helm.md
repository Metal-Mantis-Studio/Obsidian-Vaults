Helm is an open-source [[Azure Kubernetes]] package manager which simplifies deployment and management of Kubernetes applications by providing a way to define, install and upgrade them by pre-configured package bundles called "Charts".

Key components of Helm:

1. Charts: Charts are packages that contain all the necessary Kubernetes resources (like deployments, services, configmaps, etc.) required to run a particular application or service. Charts are written in YAML format and are versioned, making it easy to manage and share reusable configurations.
    
2. Helm CLI: The Helm Command Line Interface (CLI) is used to interact with Helm and manage charts. It allows users to search, install, upgrade, rollback, and delete charts on Kubernetes clusters.
    
3. Helm Repositories: Helm repositories are the locations where charts are stored. Helm can work with both public and private repositories to facilitate sharing and distribution of charts across teams or the community.
    

How Helm works:

1. Template Engine: Helm uses a template engine (Go templating) to dynamically generate Kubernetes YAML manifests based on the values provided by the user during chart installation or upgrade. This allows for customizing the resources based on specific deployment configurations.
    
2. Chart Lifecycle Management: Helm manages the entire lifecycle of a Kubernetes application from installation to upgrading and deletion. It provides an easy way to release new versions of applications and roll back to previous versions if needed.
    

Benefits of Helm:

1. Simplified Deployment: Helm abstracts the complexity of deploying applications on Kubernetes, making it easier for developers to package and distribute applications.
    
2. Reusability: Helm charts can be shared and reused, promoting collaboration and standardization across teams or the Kubernetes community.
    
3. Versioning: Helm supports versioning of charts, which helps in tracking changes and upgrades over time.
    
4. Rollbacks: Helm enables easy rollback to previous versions of an application in case of issues or failures during an update.
    
5. Dependency Management: Helm supports dependencies between charts, making it possible to manage complex applications with multiple components efficiently.
